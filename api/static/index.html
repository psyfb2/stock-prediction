          This tool will give you a bullish rating for a stock as a percentage.
          A rating of 0% would be very bearish and 100% would be very bullish.
          Concretely, the percentage represents the probability that a
          Take-Profit of 6% is hit before a Trailing-Stop-Loss of 6% is hit,
          relative to the current days open price. For more information checkout
          the github README for this project
          <a href="https://github.com/psyfb2/stock-prediction">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Warning: the rating is calculated using technical analysis and does
          not take fundementals into account. Therefore, take the rating with a
          grain of salt, especially if there is an upcoming event (e.g.
          earnings, news, etc). Furthermore, the developer of this tool cannot
          be held liable for any loss of capital, use at your own risk!

      <p class="best_threshold_text">
        The recommended buy threshold was calculated by maximizing TPR - FPR on
        the validation set. On the test set this threshold achieved 62%
        accuracy, with a precision of 55% and recall of 75% on the buy class.
        The test set dataset was slightly imbalanced with the buy class
        representing 45% of the samples. If that sounds like mandarin, then
        essentially if the bullish rating is above 40% and one was to place a
        Take-Profit of 6% and a Trailing-Stop-Loss of 6%, the Take-Profit would
        be hit approximately 55% of the time. On the other hand, when the
        bullish rating is below 40%, approximately 25% of the time the
        Take-Profit is hit, so the model is able to capture/recall 75% of the
        Take-Profit hits.
